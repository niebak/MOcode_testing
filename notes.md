# Goals
The goal of the scripts here is to create something that can help optimally prepare athletes for a competition.
## Method
One of the methods I have found is to use a CNN or a RNN to rank the difficulty of a segment in order to determine which segments are critical and which segemnts are not. If I end up using a CNN I will have to make it a sliding window application.
